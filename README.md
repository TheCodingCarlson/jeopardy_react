# Jeopardy React

### Basic Info
A small project I made to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of ReactJS. I used the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API to generate the random question data and also used [Swipe](https://github.com/thebird/Swipe) to enable swiping back and forth between questions and answers (NOTE: Swiping only works on mobile devices). [React Infinite](https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite) is used to create the infinite scrolling functionality. Enjoy!
