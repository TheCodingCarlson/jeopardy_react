# jeopardy_react

###Basic Info
A small project I made to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of React.js. I used the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API to generate the random question data and also used [Swipe](https://github.com/thebird/Swipe) to enable swiping back and forth between questions and answers. Swiping only works on mobile devices.
